          <i>Abstract</i> - Getting meaningful experience with full-stack web development, and becoming familiar with many of the latest and most ubiquitous development 
          tools has been the core of this capstone project. I felt that developing a basic social network would synthesize all of my skills in a single project; 
          I have always been interested in the design side of web development (CSS, Javascript elements, React), and I needed more experience with programming backend
          server-related tools in order to become a confident full-stack web developer.
          <br><br>
          <b>INTRODUCTION</b>
          <br><br>
          I shifted away from my initial goal (outlined in my capstone proposal) of programming the server-side of my application in Java for a number of reasons. 
          For one, I was interested in learning to use the most popular web development tools, in order to help my job prospects in the field of web programming. 
          While server-side web development in Java is incredibly powerful, used in large-scale projects and databases, and still has a solid presence in the field, 
          it is only used for backend development. Javascript is less powerful by comparison, but in smaller-scale applications, the ability to code frontend & backend 
          makes development smoother. Additionally, although I have had some experience with Java, I am by no means a confident Java developer. I feared that I would 
          be taking on more than I could handle; becoming proficient enough to develop a backend Java web application in addition to implementing WebRTC and SocketIO, 
          all in a clean-looking, secure social networking app.
          <br><br>
          Many of the other elements that I discussed with my advisor for this project, Scott Spetka, were retained in the final project. Node.JS, a Javascript runtime 
          built on Chromeâ€™s V8 engine,  was my main development tool. 
          WebRTC was always something I intended to implement into my social network site, because it supposedly integrates very cleanly into a number of environments.
	
          <br><br>
          Selbynet is a website that I designed and built from the ground up, which includes a SocketIO chat, where users can enter and type messages to each other. 
          Users are also able to create accounts, where their passwords are hashed before being stored in a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
